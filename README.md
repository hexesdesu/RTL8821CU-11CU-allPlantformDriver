# RTL8821CU_11CU-allPlantformDriver
## I bought 3 wifi dongles from JD(goudong):
> EDUP EP-AC1651

> COMFAST CF-811AC

> MERCURY UD6S

They have same RTL8811CU chipset.

I found some notes to install the driver manually on the Hub, such as https://github.com/whitebatman2/rtl8821CU.

But in this driverpack, it got a `install.sh`!

Pretty nice, huh!
